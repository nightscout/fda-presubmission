<h2>Nightscout<a class="headerlink" href="#nightscout" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Nightscout is intended to be used as part of a data management system.
The system provides for a &#8220;glanceable&#8221; secondary display of the
information originating from the Dexcom CGM.  A website allows the
display to be presented on any device which can display websites to
duplicate the display of the Dexcom.</p>
<p>The best way to get an idea of how people use Nightscout is to peruse
the <a class="reference external" href="http://imgur.com/a/cxcGG/all">public testimonials</a> of use, or the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/cgminthecloud/">Facebook group</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="communicating-recent-therapy">
<h3>Communicating recent therapy<a class="headerlink" href="#communicating-recent-therapy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The website URL is typically shared with caregivers and interested
parties.  This allows multiple people to monitor a Dexcom user&#8217;s
glucose levels from any Internet connection.  Multiple redundant
displays eliminates transcription error and raises the fidelity of
communicating current therapy status.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="glanceable-interface">
<h3>Glanceable interface<a class="headerlink" href="#glanceable-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Displays are duplicated in multiple redundant locations.  This
alleviates people from needing to physically locate and attend to the
receiver.  For example, in scenarios where no therapeutic action is
required, but the glucose levels must be considered, the glanceable
display eliminates interruptions to existing activities.  The lowered
burden enables people to be more persistently aware, and therefore
respond to scenarios with treatment with greater ease and fidelity.</p>

<div class="section" id="reliance-on-preexisting-work">
<h2>Reliance on preexisting work<a class="headerlink" href="#reliance-on-preexisting-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Nightscout project relies on commodity components, as well as the
excellent work from the folks at Dexcom.  The android software
interacting with the Dexcom receiver attempts to faithfully transmit
data from the receiver to a configured storage/data management service
hosted on the Internet.  The android software is agnostic of the data
management service, and can be configured to work with several
different data management service providers.  While Dexcom has not
sanctioned or approved the data management functions performed by
Nightscout, the software has been designed to behave
in the way that Dexcom expects all data management systems to behave.
The data management protocol was obtained through analysis of Dexcom&#8217;s
own data management software.  An open analysis of the source code
listings and comparisons of behavior reveals that the behavior of the
Dexcom receiver is unaffected when this system is in use, and matches
the intended behavior of Dexcom&#8217;s own data management software.  The
use or non-use of Nightscout has no observable difference in the
Dexcom equipment or system, either while Dexcom is in use or after.
Eg, we believe that Nightscout has no effect on Dexcom&#8217;s performance,
quality, or safety.  Dexcom became an FDA approved device in 2012 and
the accuracy of the device is well tested by thousands of patients.
Providing connectivity to manage communication of the Dexcom&#8217;s
readings makes no changes to the accuracy.  Nightscout does not modify
the blood glucose readings and thus maintains the original data
quality.</p>
<p>When Nightscout is in use, the community recommends that users
maintain their normal therapy.  Nightscout should not alter therapy
plans or decisions.  Many of the community members recommend falling
back to baby monitors, phone, SMS text message, self monitored
finger-sticks, and physically checking the Dexcom receiver as tools to
augment therapy, even while Nightscout is in use.
The guiding philosophy behind this advice is that technology is a tool
for managing therapy; that people administer therapy, not technology.
Nightscout is another tool using commonly available technology, like
baby-monitors, to bring diabetes therapy, specifically communicating
current status of therapy, more in line with the way the users of these
tools feel is acceptable.</p>
<p>Nightscout is useful any time remote near-real-time monitoring of
Dexcom readings are desirable.  People with diabetes find it useful to
keep mindfulness of glucose levels while biking or other activities
requiring both hands.  People with diabetes, or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PWD</span></tt> find it useful
to communicate fidelity of therapy, as well as find support from their
teams of caregivers.</p>
<p>Due to the ease of use, parents have been able to co-ordinate with
school Nurse to prevent or treat injuries which are otherwise common.
In some cases, use of Nightscout has helped gain insight into how
common these injuries are, and we believe that the community
aggregation tool can be used to report these injuries to the FDA for
increased oversight of Dexcom and Medtronic devices in the
marketplace.  The community has also received reports of some parents
using Nightscout to co-ordinate sleep-overs or camp visits, and in
some cases walks with Grandpa, many for the first time, that would not
other wise happen.  They all cite Nightscout&#8217;s remote telemetry in
liberating these activities, in some cases with pictures indicating
injuries staved off or critical rescue care co-ordinated.</p>
<p>Adult users have cited Nightscout in increasing discretion.  A common
complaint among users of type 1 diabetes medical equipment is that
the mandated use of the equipment combined with the time it takes to
use the equipment often presents the unknowing public with a rude
experience.  It often appears that a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PWD</span></tt> is ignoring someone by
favoring a phone or pager or just producing rude beeps.  When
Nightscout is in use, the requirement to touch one of these medical
devices disappears, which allows incorporating mindfulness more often
and in a variety of different ways into the every day work flow.  As a
result, fewer interruptions from physically touching the medical device
increases discretion because social disruptions are also reduced.</p>
<div class="section" id="nightscout-uploader-device">
<h3>Nightscout uploader device<a class="headerlink" href="#nightscout-uploader-device" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An uploader device is an Android smartphone capable of &#8220;USB OTG&#8221;
capability.  These are commonly available.  WIFI only versions, known
as &#8220;android mini-computers&#8221; or and &#8220;Android TV box&#8221; are also commonly
available.  The prices vary widely from vendor to vendor, and
depending on the cell network carrier subsidies.</p>
<p>Without any help, the DIY version requires downloading the source code
from the Internet.  Google&#8217;s Android software development kit is
required to configure and compile the source listings from the git
repository.  This process requires that users know, or learn how to,
prepare their device for debugging, go through basic debugging steps
in order to configure, compile, and deploy the software as binary
android package, and then install and run the software on their own
smartphone.</p>
