Specific Questions
==================

  * Is this a secondary or passive or active display?
  * What does distributing mean?

  * What is the medical device?  There are 6 separate open source
    projects, including this eCopy and the forums, all with separate
    maintainers and contributors.  An assembled rig without the "cloud
    services" up and running does nothing.

  * If listing source code on the Internet is widely considered "free
    speech" how does this relate to "distributing free speech?"
  * Is there an API to upload data, relating to injuries or just for all
    therapy, to the FDA in order to aide in post-market surveillance?

    * Is there a way to prepare some kind of surveillance report, or
      observations of things we have found to the FDA outside of formal
      ``PMA/510k``?

      * Should we build a "report to FDA" button into our UI to aide
        surveillance?

  * Should we develop a risk assessment framework for Nightscout?

  * Can we work on some framework to provide FDA with oversight for open
    source projects like Nightscout.

  * How would this project be categorized, pending
    http://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2014/06/fda-encourages-medical-device-data-system-innovation/
    * Is this a real-time or "active" monitoring application?

      * Does classifying this as Class III, "high risk" medical device
        make sense, empower the public to pursue safety in their own
        therapy?

    * How can open source methodology be integrated into FDA controls?

      * We want FDA to enforce protections allowing owners of devices
        to collect the data from those devices.  We might propose some
        kind of explore "time in range" endpoint which indicates
        absence of harm due to therapy?  Can we nullify the
        proprietary protections given to vendors if they have not
        provided satisfactory evidence that their device enables safe
        therapy?

      * Is there a De Novo classification process that would make sense, given
        the relative risk?

  * Do any of the FDA certifications/approvals offer additional
    protection from liability, perhaps as outlined by Karen Sandler in "Killed
    by Code, Transparent Medical Devices?"
