Specific Questions
==================

* Is this a secondary or passive or active display?
* What does distributing mean?

* What is the medical device?  There are 6 separate open source
  projects, including this pre-sub and the forums, all with separate
  maintainers and contributors.  An assembled rig without the "cloud
  services" up and running does nothing.

* If listing source code on the internet is widely considered "free
  speech" how does this relate to "distributing free speech?"
* Is there an API to upload data, relating to injuries or just for all
  therapy, to the FDA in order to aide in post-market surveillance?

  * Is there a way to prepare some kind of surveillance report, or
    observations of things we have found to the FDA outside of formal
    PMA/510k?
    * Should we build a "report to FDA" button into our UI to aide
      surveillance?

* Should we develop a risk assessment framework for Nightscout?

* Can we work on some framework to provide FDA with oversight for open
  source projects like Nightscout.

g. Specific Questions
---------------------

The Pre-Sub should include specific questions regarding review issues
relevant to a planned IDE, or marketing application (e.g., questions
regarding pre-clinical and clinical testing protocols or data
requirements) as our advice will be guided by your questions and may
not identify all submission requirements. Appendix 1 of this guidance
contains sections specific to IDE, 510(k), PMA, and HDE that list
examples of questions appropriate to each submission and application
type.
