g. Specific Questions
---------------------

The Pre-Sub should include specific questions regarding review issues
relevant to a planned IDE, or marketing application (e.g., questions
regarding pre-clinical and clinical testing protocols or data
requirements) as our advice will be guided by your questions and may
not identify all submission requirements. Appendix 1 of this guidance
contains sections specific to IDE, 510(k), PMA, and HDE that list
examples of questions appropriate to each submission and application
type.
