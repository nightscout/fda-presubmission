Process updates
===============

A brief synopsis of the Nightscout process is discussed here.  For record
keeping, a more detailed look at each of the processes discussed is kept in
process-controls:

* http://process-controls.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
* https://github.com/nightscout/process-controls/tree/master/source

These documents are to help follow up with the gap analysis requested in
October's meeting.  When they reach 1.0.0 status, they will be provided to the
FDA through formal submission channels.

other social networking sites.

The in depth analysis includes a description of the quality controls
