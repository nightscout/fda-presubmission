Process updates
===============

A brief synopsis of the Nightscout process is discussed here.  For record
keeping, a more detailed look at each of the processes discussed is kept in
process-controls:

* http://process-controls.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
* https://github.com/nightscout/process-controls/tree/master/source

These documents are to help follow up with the gap analysis requested in
October's meeting.  When they reach 1.0.0 status, they will be provided to the
FDA through formal submission channels.

High level overview
###################
A high level overview of our development process, contributing guidelines, how
documentation, issues, and updates are tracked using Github, Facebook, and
other social networking sites.

The in depth analysis includes a description of the `_quality controls` and is
modeled roughly around the `_quality systems regulations` with a side by side
comparison of how processes on social networks work to pursue quality,
providing an operational audit trail through the networks' APIs.

Audit log of operations
#######################

A second, _`operations logs` also helps document specific and insightful
examples of how processes have influenced operations, or how growth and
operations has effected processes.  We anticipate this being an audit log of
the processes as well as provide a view of the processes at work.
