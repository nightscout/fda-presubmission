=============

A number of informal discussions have taken place between the FDA and
the Nightscout contributors.  The discussions have revealed a need to
establish a framework for open source authors and FDA to work
together in order to best protect and promote public safety.
We seek the FDA's guidance in finding similar frameworks from other
regulated or life-critical areas such as defense, aviation, and
automotive industries.
