<h3>Nightscout begins<a class="headerlink" href="#nightscout-begins" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As an open source project, the entire source code came into existence
when people affected by type 1 diabetes with access to the best and
safest therapy options found themselves unable to obtain therapy
without any adverse events.  In order to help monitor, communicate,
and understand therapy, a few individuals created a data management
system using commodity equipment allowing them to easily monitor the
CGM without requiring physical access to the CGM receiver.  Spurred by
the improved family relationships and finding therapy easier to track,
communicate, and manage, more and more people have added small
improvements or helped others to gain liberties on their own.  Many of
these individuals cite &#8220;keeping their own children safe&#8221; as reasons
for beginning their involvement with the project.</p>
<p>As of July 1, 2014, a dozen or so like-minded individuals record all
proposed changes in their own Github forks or Github branches
dedicated to discussing improvements or changes to a code base that is
in active use by several dozen individuals and families.  After the
community reviews and tests these proposals in a public audit called a
&#8220;pull request,&#8221; one of the core contributors accepts the changes into
the &#8220;master&#8221; branch.  This workflow is sometimes called &#8220;gitflow&#8221;
<a class="reference external" href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/</a>.</p>
<p>After the &#8220;master&#8221; branch has updated with changes relevant to the
community, specially crafted pull requests allow tracking the exact
git deltas necessary to bring another repo up to date with the
community accepted versions.  When community members report bugs, this
tracking system allows developers to reproduce and co-ordinate fixes,
in some cases specifically tailored to members&#8217; needs.</p>
<p>For example, in one instance, a several individuals outside the U.S.
needed displays in mmol/l vs mg/dl.  A group of interested members
teamed up to work on special mmol/l versions.  The member actually
completed the required changes, sharing the needed deltas with the
group.  As a result, we were able to re-use these same git tracking
methods to compare and issue updates specifically for these users
needing mmol/l.</p>

<div class="section" id="open-source-methodology">
<h3>Open source methodology<a class="headerlink" href="#open-source-methodology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The development of Nightscout as an open source project follows a
predictable development pattern to identify issues, incorporate bug
fixes, as well as develop new features.  The model, as discussed by
Gabriel Coleman in <a class="reference external" href="http://codingfreedom.com/">Coding Freedom</a> relies heavily on an open review
process to share and distribute improvements.</p>
<p>The Software Freedom Law Center, in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2010/transparent-medical-devices.pdf">Transparent medical devices</a>,
also outlines the need for greater transparency in the operation of
these medical devices.  We encourage the FDA to adopt regulations that
are consistent with the protections provided by open source methods,
including <a class="reference external" href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html">Linus&#8217;s Law</a> to make all bugs shallow and accessible to
those affected by them.
In designing Nightscout, we try to adhere to the design principles
outlined in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html">Unix philosophy</a> in order to ensure safe, predictable,
and effective operation of the Nightscout rig.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="known-issues">
<h3>Known issues<a class="headerlink" href="#known-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are several proposed improvements and known issues.  Notably,
the system as-is is not HIPAA compliant.  One of the key features in
this system that has helped to liberate people, and thus make them
safer, is the ease of use that accompanies pubically accessible data.
While we will adopt optional controls for authorizing and accessing
data, parents of this system value easily sharing data with a school
nurse with minimum hassle.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="future-plans">
<h2>Future plans<a class="headerlink" href="#future-plans" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The sponsors would like to discuss appropriate regulatory controls
that protect open source authors&#8217; free speech as well as provides FDA
with an appropriate framework to fulfill their mission.</p>
<div class="section" id="oversight">
<h3>Oversight<a class="headerlink" href="#oversight" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Given the community&#8217;s frustration with safety in available medical
devices to manage type 1 diabetes therapy, we believe there are
opportunities for open source authors and FDA to work together.  One
such opportunity is in post-market surveillance.  We have developed an
aggregator which re-displays de-personalized many Nightscout remote
monitors in a single &#8220;spaghetti plot.&#8221;  We propose modifying this
aggregator to automatically compile and submit reports to the FDA in
order to aide in post market surveillance of devices used in diabetes
therapy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="integration">
<h3>Integration<a class="headerlink" href="#integration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the interest of safety, we need a single display to contextually
manage type 1 diabetes.  We will add data transfer from Medtronic
insulin pumps to obtain &#8220;treatment&#8221; data consisting of the bolus
wizard and bolus records.  Additionally, the display will
automatically show both the treatment data, carbohydrates, insulin,
and carb ration, from the insulin pump overlaid with glucose readings
from the Dexcom CGM.</p>
<p>In addition, we will also explore integrating with many other health,
fitness, and nutrition APIs.</p>
<p>We will follow up with additional pre-subs if required to discuss
further development efforts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="operational-metadata">
<h3>Operational metadata<a class="headerlink" href="#operational-metadata" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We anticipate adding indicators showing the connectivity status of the
uploader device, as well as battery status, and other operational
details of the system.  These details will help quickly assess
validity of the data, and whether or not the system is working and
trustworthy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="access-controls">
<h3>Access controls<a class="headerlink" href="#access-controls" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>During development, the community has expressed an interest in
developing access controls to help protect who can access displays.
We anticipate development of &#8220;named views&#8221; which can be used to
control who accesses the remote monitor website, as well as when and
how.  These views may optionally be protected by username/password
type of login system, or through creating unique and opaquely encoded
tokens explicitly for sharing.  We have found that the flexibility in
sharing information publically outweighs the risks in the data being
made public.  As the community and software matures, we anticipate
personalizing the access controls to meet the needs of its users.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="support-commercialization">
<h3>Support/Commercialization<a class="headerlink" href="#support-commercialization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One criticism of open source is the lack of commercial support for
individuals who lack the ability to safely assemble and operate their
own rig.  While the open source culture provides a large community
able to train and offer support, the project remains accessible only
to those with sufficient technical ability to assemble and debug their
own equipment.  We propose that the community would be safer if the
public could buy pre-assembled rigs on the market with support
contracts to help ensure high quality operation for individuals
lacking the time and effort.  However, we are concerned that the
current regulations considering this a &#8220;high risk&#8221; device prevents
unprepared individuals from obtaining the help they need.</p>
