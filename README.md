# nightscout fda presubmission

sphinx presub ecopy source

Simple project to hold the content for an FDA presubmission.
All text.

It should:
  * communicate to the FDA description of what we are interested
  * List of unanswered questions for the FDA to answer

The description should give enough information to set context for the
questions, and allow them to assign an knowledgeable team to answer
the questions.
