Proposed Use
============

Nightscout
^^^^^^^^^^
Nightscout is intended to be used as part of a data management system.
The system provides for a "glanceable" secondary display of the
information originating from the Dexcom CGM.  A website allows the
display to be presented on any device which can display websites to
duplicate the display of the Dexcom.


Single pane of glass
++++++++++++++++++++
The website url is typically shared with caregivers and interested
parties.  This allows multiple people to monitor a Dexcom user's
glucose levels from concurrently from any internet connection.

Glanceability
+++++++++++++
Displays are duplicated in multiple redundant locations.  This
alleviates people from needing to physically locate and attend to the
receiver.  The lowered burden enables people to be more persistently
aware, and therefore respond to scenarios with treatment with greater
ease.

For example, in scenarios where no therapeutic action is required, but
the glucose levels must be considered, the glanceable display
eliminates the 30 second interuption to an existing workflow.

d. Proposed Intended Use/Indications for Use
--------------------------------------------

Please provide sufficient information regarding the proposed intended
use/indications for use, 

which may include: 

* identification of the disease or condition the device is indicated
  to prevent, mitigate, screen, monitor, treat, or diagnose; 

* identification of the target population; 

* part of the body or type of tissue to which applied or with which
  the device is interacting; 

* frequency of use; 

* physiological use; and 

* statement of whether the device is intended for prescription and/or
  over-the-counter use. 

For an IVD device, this information should include a detailed draft of
the intended use of the device including the intended use population,
the analyte/condition to detect, and the assay methodology (see
Section F of Appendix 1 for more detailed information).
