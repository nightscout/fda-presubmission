The Nightscout contributors look forward to meeting and discussing
these matters in depth.  We will provide individuals to meet with,
although as an open source project, no individual fully represents the
community.
We look forward to face to face converstations, emails, and phone
calls per FDA availability.  As members of the wearenotwaiting
movement, we encourage swift and iterative responses, integrated with
the MDDS guidance.
