h. Method for Feedback
----------------------

You should specify how you prefer FDA to provide the feedback you are
seeking. You may request our feedback through an in-person meeting, a
teleconference, facsimile, or by email.  Please note that FDA will
ultimately decide the means of communicating the feedback, but will
consider the desired method requested in the Pre-Sub. If FDA has
already agreed to a meeting, it is the sponsor’s decision regarding
whether this previously scheduled meeting should occur even if FDA has
provided a written response to the sponsor’s questions. If we provide
feedback through a meeting or teleconference, the final meeting
minutes will be considered FDA’s formal written feedback (see Section
IV.D. below).  


If you are requesting a meeting or teleconference as the method for
feedback, your submission should include: 

* the meeting format you are requesting (i.e., in-person or by
  teleconference); 

* three (3) or more preferred dates and times when you are available
  to meet using the guidelines in Table 1 above for scheduling; 

* the planned attendees, including each attendee’s position, or title,
  and affiliation. If you have not yet identified all of your
  attendees, you should indicate the type of subject matter experts
  you plan to invite so that we can ensure appropriate FDA experts are
  in attendance. Please note foreign visitors meeting in an FDA
  facility require advanced security clearance. See Section IV. B.
  “Security Screening” below for additional information on how to
  request security clearance for Foreign Nationals; and 

* a list of any audiovisual equipment you will need, such as
  conference phone or LCD projector. 



You should propose the duration of the meeting you are requesting.  In
our experience, one (1) hour is adequate for most meetings. If you
believe that more than one (1) hour is needed, please provide a
rationale for the duration you propose. You should also refer to the
rationale and confirm the duration requested when the division contact
person schedules your meeting.  


We recommend that your agenda allocate the last ten (10) minutes of
the meeting for summarizing the discussions and any next steps or
action items.
